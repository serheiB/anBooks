Gitpod is the online IDE for GitHub.

It launches a complete dev environment for any GitHub project, by simply prefixing the GitHub URL with gitpod.io/#.

Install this app and prebuild your project, so you don't have to wait for your build to download the internet when starting a Gitpod workspace. rocket

Gitpod is the first IDE that builds your project before you even open it.
